Urgent Todo's - 
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes.
- actually add content 
- ios builds
- take hod's permission and launch this publicly
- readme and hosting on github and sharing it with firebase app distribution

Future Improvements - 
- google ads
- dark mode
- better organization of json / using actual database like supabase/firestore/mongodb

- search button (to find words inside a pdf)
- ability to copy text from a pdf
- smooth scrolling (increase sensitivity)
- refactor the entire codebase and make it better organized manually (remove duplications , divide widgets into seperate classes)


Optimize for performance by reducing widget rebuilds and using tools like flutter analyze and flutter doctor.

Use MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder to adapt layouts dynamically.

Push Notifications:
Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications for updates or new materials.

User Feedback:
Add a feedback form to collect user suggestions and bug reports.

Analytics Enhancements:
Track user retention and engagement over time.
Add custom events for more granular insights.

In-App Updates:
Implement in-app updates to notify users about new versions.

Monetization:
Consider adding ads (e.g., Google AdMob)

Introduce proper state management (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) instead of passing raw lists down multiple screens.
Implement offline-first storage (e.g., Hive/SQflite) and background download notifications to meet the “offline access” promise.

Replace static Firebase Hosting JSON with an admin-friendly backend (Firestore/Supabase) and secure upload endpoints before crowd contributions.
Refresh README/docs (real text, screenshots, contribution guide) and add a CHANGELOG for future releases.
