Urgent Todo's - 
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes.
- actually add content 
- ios builds
- take hod's permission and launch this publicly
- readme and hosting on github and sharing it with firebase app distribution

Future Improvements - 
- google ads
- dark mode
- better organization of json / using actual database like supabase/firestore/mongodb

- search button (to find words inside a pdf)
- ability to copy text from a pdf
- smooth scrolling (increase sensitivity)
- refactor the entire coedbase and make it better organized manually


Optimize for performance by reducing widget rebuilds and using tools like flutter analyze and flutter doctor.

Use MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder to adapt layouts dynamically.
