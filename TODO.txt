Urgent Todo's -

- search button (to find words inside a pdf)
- ability to copy text from a pdf
- smooth scrolling (increase sensitivity)


Use high-quality icons (e.g., Material Icons, Ionicons, or custom SVGs).

Optimize for performance by reducing widget rebuilds and using tools like flutter analyze and flutter doctor.

Use MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder to adapt layouts dynamically.
